# Project: Recipe-Tracking-App

<img src="https://ianfinley.com/images/recipe-app.PNG">

I built a Recipe tracking app! The app will allow a user to `create` new recipes, display a list of recipes and `delete` a recipe from the list by clicking a delete button. I also added styling following a mockup.

##
## Learning Objectives

- The app will display a recipe's name, cuisine, photo, ingredients, preparation instructions and action buttons (edit and delete).
- Should create at least one additional component that is used by the RecipeList component.
- The app does not need to match the exact appearance of the mockup, but should be similar and pass the styling tests.
- Should add handlers and other attributes to the starter code as needed.

##
## Skills Used

- React.js
- Javascript
- HTML / JSX
- CSS

##
## Tasks Completed

- User can create a recipe entry.
- User can read the list of recipes.
- User can delete a recipe.
- CSS is used to make the app look like the mockup.
- Uses multiple components that play well together.
- Recipe data is contained in the state.
- Minimal code duplication
